HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN WSIG-EXAMPLES IN 5 STEPS

Human requirements :
  * Be familiar with Eclipse IDE
  * Be familiar with Jade
  * Knowing how to install and set up Tomcat (out of consideration here)

Notes :
  * This document is about the setting of a development environment for WSIG, 
    do not use it in production mode.
  * The tutorial is based on the WSIG guide (v2.1), especially the MathAgent example.


======================================
STEP 1 - INSTALLING TOMCAT AND ECLIPSE 
======================================

First install Tomcat. It is available in official repositories for Ubuntu. 
In this system, do not forget to remove the autostart daemon by the following 
command line :

sudo update-rc.d -f tomcat5.5 remove

Install the Eclipse you want (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). We use the 
Classic distribution in this tutorial. Create an empty workspace dedicated to 
the project, and restart Eclipse to use it. Go to "Help > Software Updates", 
then add http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/updates in sites. Install Java EE 
Developer Tools (in Eclipse Web Tools Project (WTP) 3.0.3). Note that Axis is 
not required because WSIG distribution contains it. Finally add the site 
http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.4.x, and download Subclipse, an integrated 
SVN tool.


============================
STEP 2 - GETTING THE PROJECT
============================

Click on "File > New > Other... > SVN > Checkout Projects from SVN", and 
"create a new repository location", then add http://wsig-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/. 
Select "wsig-examples-read-only" and finish.

Once the repository content downloaded and the workspace automatically updated, 
Eclipse declares an error :
"Target runtime Apache Tomcat v5.5 is not defined. wsig-examples Unknown Faceted Project Problem"

This is normal at this stage, we will define a server in step 4.


=================================
STEP 3 - JADE PLATFORM AND AGENTS
=================================

Create and start the following Debug Configurations as "Java Application" :
runJadePlatform :
Project = wsig-examples
Main class = jade.Boot
Program arguments = -gui
Click on "Debug" to launch the Jade platform.

runMathAgent :
Project = wsig-examples
Main class = jade.Boot
Program arguments = -gui -container "MathAgent1:com.tilab.wsig.examples.MathAgent(MathFunctions false)" -name "WSIGTestPlatform"
Click on "Debug" to launch the MathAgent1 agent, instance of MathFunctions.

runMathAgentPrefix :
Project = wsig-examples
Main class = jade.Boot
Program arguments = -gui -container "MathAgent2:com.tilab.wsig.examples.MathAgent(MathFunctions false second)" -name "WSIGTestPlatform"
Click on "Debug" to launch the MathAgent2 agent, instance of MathFunctions.

runMathAgentMapper :
Project = wsig-examples
Main class = jade.Boot
Program arguments = -gui -container "MathAgent3:com.tilab.wsig.examples.MathAgent(MathFunctionsMapper true)" -name "WSIGTestPlatform"
Click on "Debug" to launch the MathAgent3 agent, instance of MathFunctionsMapper.


In the future, agents will be directly launchable through the toolbar : 
Debug > runJadePlatform
Debug > runMathAgent
Debug > runMathAgentPrefix
Debug > runMathAgentMapper

The Jade Platform GUI must have appeared. You can now see the 3 agents evolving 
in 3 different containers. These agents are independent from each other.


==========================
STEP 4 - ADDING THE SERVER
==========================

Switch on JavaEE perspective. Select the wsig-examples project and create the 
application's Debug Configuration (Debug As > Debug on server) : choose 
"Manually define a new server" of type "Apache > Tomcat v5.5 Server", tick 
"Always use this server when running this project", and click on Next. Fill in the 
installation path of Tomcat, "/usr/share/tomcat5.5" on Ubuntu 7.10, and click on 
Next. Add wsig-examples to the projects configured for this server, and finish.

In projects view, a new project appeared : "Servers". It contains a directory 
with Tomcat configuration files inside (the XML files). To know the listened 
port by the server, open server.xml. This is my default configuration :

<!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8180 -->
<Connector acceptCount="100" connectionTimeout="20000" disableUploadTimeout="true" 
enableLookups="false" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192" maxSpareThreads="75" maxThreads="150" 
minSpareThreads="25" port="8180" redirectPort="8443"/>
...
<!-- Define an AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->
<Connector enableLookups="false" port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443"/>

If you change the ports, modifications will be synchronized immediately. 

The wsig-examples application is declared at the end of the file :

<Context docBase="wsig-examples" path="/wsig-examples" reloadable="true" 
source="org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.server:wsig-examples"/></Host>

When "reloadable" is "true", the modifications are directly propagated on the 
server, which is very useful to test source code on the fly. Without 
this mechanism, you would have to package the application in a war archive and 
deploy it on the server each time you want to test it.


===========================
STEP 5 - DEPLOYMENT AND USE
===========================

The server starts immediately after having been added, and deploys the application.
The ControlWSIG agent is then created inside WSIG-Container. The WSIG console
is available on http://localhost:8180/wsig-examples/ with your favorite browser.
The web services corresponding to our agents are listed in Home page, in WSIG Services List.
Go to the Test page to execute the sample requests proposed in package 
src/com.tilab.wsig.examples.xml : copy the XML content to test in "SOAP request". 
Send the request, and that's it !

If the server replies that the web service doesn't exist ("Service xxx not present in 
wsig"), you should check that the corresponding agent is started.
If you deactivate the ControlWSIG agent through the web console and reactivate it, 
the other agents will be stopped. Start them again (without stopping the 
server), and refresh the Home page to see them again in the list.

To stop everything properly, right click on the server name and stop it. Then 
stop Jade through the GUI by clicking on "File > Shut down Agent Platform".
